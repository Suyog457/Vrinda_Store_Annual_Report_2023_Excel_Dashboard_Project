Objective / Problem Statement

Vrinda  Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2023. So that Varinda can understand its customers and grow more sales in 2024.
To Work On This Project Data Analysis Process Include the following steps

Sample Questions
1.Compare the sales and orders using a single chart
2 .Which month got the highest sales and orders?
3 .Who purchased more- men or women in 2022? 
4 .What are the different order status in 2022?
5 .List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
6 .Relation between age and gender based on number ¢
7 .Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
8. Highest Selling Category?, etc.

1) Data Cleaning:-
   
Data Cleaning is a process in which we clean the data so that we can understand the data clearly and get results according to the desired output. In Data Cleaning the majority of tasks are such as checking the data types of columns, removing columns, inserting columns, and checking the duplicate and null values.
In this Vrinda Store, I have done the same things that I mentioned earlier. Very soon I will make a Video Presentation on this project that will help you to understand the project.

3) Data Processing:-
   
In Data Processing we do some calculations so that it can help us to find the results.
In this project, I have used an IF Formula so that I can get a general idea of Age Group to understand what age and gender of people are prime customers of Vrinda Store. This is used to solve the problem statement no 3.
Now I used a TEXT Formula to extract the Month from the date column. This will help me to find the highest month that will help to solve Vrinda Store problem statement number 2

5) Data Analysis:-
   
Data analysis is the process of cleaning, changing, and processing raw data and extracting actionable, relevant information that helps businesses make informed decisions. The procedure helps reduce the risks inherent in decision-making by providing useful insights and statistics, often presented in charts, images, tables, and graphs. 
Then I use Pivot Table to analyze the data. What is a Pivot Table

What is a PivotTable used for?

A Pivot Table is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. You can use a Pivot Table to analyze numerical data in detail and answer unanticipated questions about your data. A PivotTable is specially designed for Querying large amounts of data in many user-friendly ways.

4) Data Visualization:-
   
Data visualization is the representation of data through the use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.
These are most charts that are used in Excel:
Line Chart
Scatter Plot
Bar Chart
Sunburst Chart
Sankey Chart
Radar Chart
Likert Scale Chart
Comparison Chart
Pareto Chart
Box & Whisker Plot
But In My Project I Can Use Bar Chart , Combo Chart, Cluster Column Chart , Pie Chart Line Chart

5) Slicer:-
   
I used Slicer which provides buttons that you can click to filter tables, or PivotTables. In addition to quick filtering, slicers also indicate the current filtering state, which makes it easy to understand what exactly is currently displayed.
The Slicers are on the left side of the report named "Month", "Category", "Channel"
This is what the Vrinda Annual Sales 2023 Report looks like

Sample Insights:-

1) Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65)
2) Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%)
3) Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%)
4) Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%)
   
Final Conclusion to improve Vrinda store sales :-

Target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) live
Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by showing
ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra
